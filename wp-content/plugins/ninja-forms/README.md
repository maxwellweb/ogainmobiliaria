Here are just a few of the things you will find in Ninja Forms:

* Custom input masks allow you to restrict user input in your forms for things like phone numbers, currency, and dates.
* Manage, Edit, and Export form user submissions.
* Save fields as favorites and re-use them in multiple forms.
* Export and Import forms and favorite fields.
* Set required fields.
* Add a datepicker to text fields.
* Email form results to any number of pre-determined email addresses, as well as specific messages to the user filling out the form.
* Customize form emails with the WordPress editor.
* Anti-Spam field.
* Extremely developer friendly.
* Submit your form by reloading the page or asynchronously with AJAX.
* Please note that if you are using a version of PHP lower than 5.3, you may experience some problems using AJAX Submissions. These can be minimized by using simple success/error messages without any quotes or special characters.
